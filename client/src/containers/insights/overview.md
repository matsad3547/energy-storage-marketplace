#### Entelx Insights

**Entelx** processes are based on a three week moving average of the locational marginal price data associated with your project's location.  **Charge Events** are prices that are above the moving average, while **Discharge Events** are below that average.  

**Insights** provides a deeper understanding of the locational marginal price data associated with your project.  The default date range encompasses the previous three months.  This date range can be adjusted by hour, day, week, or month and can be set to any range within time span of the data stored for the project node (one year).
