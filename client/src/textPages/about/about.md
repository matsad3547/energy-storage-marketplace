### About this Project
This project is a show case to:
* Demonstrate my design and development skills
* An opportunity to learn backend development, databases, dev-ops, product design, and data science.
* Investigate what seems like an obvious opportunity
* Limitations:
  1. Data streams - I started with LMP for arbitrage - will look into additional data streams that could calculate additional revenue streams, ie: frequency regulation, peak shaving, avoided costs,
  2. Completeness  

### About Me
* I used to be a manufacturing engineer
* I'm now a software developer
* I went to a bootcamp to learn frontend development
* I write frontend code, predominantly React.  
* I want to find a role to play fostering the transition to renewable energy
* With no formal training in renewables, I figure the best path forward is to start my own project or to demonstrate to others who already have that I have relevant skills.
