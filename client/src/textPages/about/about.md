_Accelerating Energy Intelligence_  

One of the greatest roadblocks to further renewable development is essentially a problem of coordination and data:
* How can solar and wind energy find markets when resources are abundant?
* Where are the best places to site renewable generation or storage assets?
* What would the ROI be for a storage project of a given size, power, and location?

Essentially, how can more wind, solar, and storage be deployed to the grid and still make money?

These are the sorts of questions **Entelx** is built to engage. **Entelx** is a data intelligence platform for renewable energy and energy storage. It uses publicly available data streams (currently weather and CAISO locational marginal prices) to provide geographically specific data to inform investment and arbitrage decision.  

* Monitor the charge status and revenue of a storage project using the project Dashboard.
* Examine data periods with the Historical data visualizer.  
* The Insights tool permits a deeper dive into data selectable by time period.  

To try out these tools, select [Demo](./demo) and create a project.  The current version of **Entelx** permits creating projects in the CAISO service area, highlighted in orange.

#### About this Project

While this project has some ambitious aims, it is at a very early stage of development. Data streams are currently limited locational marginal pricing and weather the two streams are not well coordinated.  The insights available and algorithms used are very rudimentary.  It is very much a work in progress!

I look forward to further developing the product including finding additional data streams for calculating other energy storage revenue streams relating to frequency regulation, peak shaving, avoided costs,

Beyond developing a product, this project is also a showcase for my frontend development skills and testing ideas about architecture, design, and UI/UX. Further, it continues to be a vehicle for professional development. To get to the current state, I've had to learn about backend development, databases, dev-ops, product design, and data science.   

#### About Me
My name is Matt Sadauckas and I am trying to find a role to play in the transition to sustainable energy.  I've had an interest in climate change, energy, and sustainability for quite a while and I changed careers to software development three years ago from manufacturing in part to develop a better skillset for this arena.  

I have no formal training in renewables specifically, but I do have some in math, physics, and engineering.  I also read as many renewables industry related articles and listen to as many podcasts related to the industry as possible.  

I also have a lot of experience building things.  I come from a machine design and manufacturing engineering background and that experience is very helpful in my software development career.  I do mostly frontend development by trade, but I'm very interested in data science, UI/UX, and backend development.

If you have questions, comments, or feedback good, bad, or otherwise, I would love to hear from you - contact information is [here](./contact).
