_Accelerating Energy Intelligence_  

Entelx is a data intelligence platform for renewable energy and energy storage. It uses publicly available data streams (currently weather and CAISO locational marginal prices) to provide geographically specific data to inform investment and arbitrage.  

* Monitor the charge status and revenue of a storage project using the Project Dashboard.
* Examine data periods with the Historical data visualizer.  
* The Insights tool permits a deeper dive into data selectable by time period.  

To try out these tools, select [Demo](./demo) and create a project.  The current version of Entelx permits creating projects in the CAISO service area, highlighted in orange.

#### About this Project

One of the greatest roadblocks to further renewable development is essentially a problem of coordination and data for which software is the obvious solution.  

This project is a show case to:
* Demonstrate my design and development skills
* An opportunity to learn backend development, databases, dev-ops, product design, and data science.
* Investigate what seems like an obvious opportunity
* Limitations:
  1. Data streams - I started with LMP for arbitrage - will look into additional data streams that could calculate additional revenue streams, ie: frequency regulation, peak shaving, avoided costs,
  2. Completeness  

#### About Me
My name is Matt Sadauckas and I am trying to find a role to play in the transition to sustainable energy.  I've had an interest in climate change, energy, and sustainability for quite a while and I changed careers to software development three years ago from manufacturing in part to develop a better skillset for this arena.  

I have no formal training in renewables specifically, but I do have some in math, physics, and engineering.  I also read as many renewables industry related articles and listen to as many podcasts as possible.  

I also have a lot of experience building things.  I come from a machine design and manufacturing engineering background and that experience is very helpful in my software development career.  I do mostly frontend development by trade, but I'm very interested in data science, UI/UX, and backend development.

If you have questions, comments, or feedback good, bad, or otherwise, I would love to hear from you - contact information is [here](./contact).
