# How do I add examples to the optimization-js library?

Examples are great to communicate the capabilities of the library
and to provide initial boilerplate code for the users. 

Hence we are very happy to have any additional examples
to the ones we already have! Add those new examples in 
the `examples` folder. It is best to simply copy the structure
of existing ones.

Try to have least code and computational complexity of examples,
 while not sacrificing the generality. For complex
showcases of optimization-js, consider instead adding
it to `demos`.

It is important that examples are kept up to date and 
in a working condition. In order to ensure this, examples 
are unit tested. If you add or change the examples, please
 make sure that unit tests are updated accordingly.
