_Accelerating Energy Intelligence_  

Among the many roadblocks to the mass deployment of renewable energy are issues at the juncture of economics and data:
* How can solar and wind energy find markets when resources are abundant?
* Where are the best places to site renewable generation or storage assets?
* What would the ROI be for a storage project of a given size, power, and location?

Essentially, how can more wind, solar, and storage be deployed to the grid and still make money?

These are the sorts of questions **Entelx** is built to engage. **Entelx** is a data intelligence platform for renewable energy and energy storage. It uses publicly available data streams (currently weather and CAISO locational marginal prices) to provide geographically specific data to inform investment and arbitrage decision.  

* Monitor the charge status and revenue of a storage project using the project Dashboard.
* Examine data periods with the Historical data visualizer.  
* Dive deeper into data selectable by time period with the Insights tool.  

To try out these tools, select [Demo](./demo) and create a project.  The current version of **Entelx** permits creating projects in the CAISO service area, highlighted in orange.

#### About this Project

While this project has some ambitious aims, it is still at a very early stage of development. Data streams are currently limited locational marginal pricing and weather and the two streams are not well coordinated.  The insights available and algorithms used are very rudimentary.  It is very much a work in progress!

I look forward to further developing the product including finding additional data streams for calculating other energy storage revenue streams relating to frequency regulation, peak shaving, avoided costs,

Beyond developing a product, this project is also a showcase for my frontend development skills and for testing ideas about architecture, design, and UI/UX.

It is also vehicle for professional development. I've had to move far beyond any formal training to learn about backend development, databases, dev-ops, product design, and data science. While there is also a tiny bit of Python, **Entelx** is built almost entirely with ES6 Javascript:
* Node back end
* React front end
* MySql databases
* knex database interfaces
* Recharts and D3 for charting
* Mapbox for maps

The code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/matsad3547/entelx).

#### About Me
My name is Matt Sadauckas and I want to find a role to play in the transition to sustainable energy.  I've had an interest in climate change, energy, and sustainability for quite a while and I changed careers from manufacturing to software development three years ago in part to develop a better skillset for this arena.  

I have no formal training in renewables specifically, but I do have some in math, physics, and engineering and I consume as many renewables industry related articles, books and podcasts as possible.  

I also have a lot of experience building things.  I come from a machine design and manufacturing engineering background and that experience is very helpful in my software development career.  I do mostly frontend development by trade, but I'm very interested in data science, UI/UX, and backend development.

I've been thinking about this project since even before I transitioned to software development.  Like most side projects, this one has progressed in fits and starts with motivation and worries of hubris.  I have not been able to give it up, so I've just kept working on it.  If you have questions, comments, or feedback good, bad, or otherwise, I would love to hear from you - contact information is [here](./contact).
