As I've detailed [here](./about) the idea of this project has be rattling around my brain for the last three years, even prior to changing careers to software development.  In fact, building something like this was among the reasons I undertook that change.

I would like help making it better. If you have feedback, advice, or interest in this project, please contact me either on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/matsad111) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-sadauckas-68bb9793/).
